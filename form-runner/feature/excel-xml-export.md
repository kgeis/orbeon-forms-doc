# Excel and XML Export

## Availability

[\[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2021.1\]](/release-notes/orbeon-forms-2021.1.md)

This is an Orbeon Forms PE feature.

## Formats

### Introduction

Form Runner can export form data in two formats:

- `excel-named-ranges` : Excel with named ranges
- `xml-form-structure-and-data`: XML with form structure and data

In each case, the export is done on the basis of a single document.

For a comprehensive export of form definitions and form data, see [Exporting form definitions and form data](/form-runner/feature/exporting-form-definitions-and-form-data.md).

### Excel with named ranges

#### Introduction

This feature is aimed at organizations whose users are familiar with Excel spreadsheets. Users can export a form to a spreadsheet and fill it out on their computers. They can pass the spreadsheet around for other users to complete it. When they are done, they can import the resulting spreadsheet back to Orbeon Forms, where the data is captured, validated, shown to the user for review, and then saved to the Orbeon Forms database.

For more about the import feature, see [Excel and XML Import](/form-runner/feature/excel-xml-import.md).

The Excel document contains all the fields of the form, attempting to mirror the layout of the original form. This includes section titles and field labels.

You can export an Excel file from the following locations:

| Page                     | Data Included |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Form Builder             | No            |
| Form Runner Summary page | Yes           |
| Form Runner Detail page  | Yes           |

The export feature produces Excel files that look like this:

#### Named ranges

Orbeon Forms includes, in the generated Excel file, named ranges which match the control names assigned in Form Builder. This allows reimporting data in those cells during a subsequent import.

Excel names do not support all the characters supported in Form Runner names. In addition, Excel has some very specific and poorly documented rules for name ranges for names that look like cell references. Such names are modified by Orbeon Forms when needed with an `_` prefix. The following shows some modification that are performed by Orbeon Forms:

| Original Name | Modified Name |
|---------------|---------------|
| `C`           | `_C`          |
| `c`           | `_c`          |
| `R`           | `_R`          |
| `r`           | `_r`          |
| `B1`          | `_B1`         |
| `C1_FOO`      | `_C1_FOO`     |
| `C123456`     | `_C123456`    |
| `AA1`         | `_AA1`        |
| `AAA1`        | `_AAA1`       |

Excel allows you to see the name of a given cell or range:

#### Repeated content

In the case of repeated grids, groups of cells share the same name.

![Repeated grid in Excel](/form-builder/images/excel-export-repeat-export.png)

Repeated grids, or repeated sections containing only non-repeated grids, are "flattened". That is, all form controls are presented in a single Excel row, with one row for each repetition.

#### Lists of choices

Lists of choices are exported as text, showing the value of the choice between parentheses, and the label next to it.

When importing, the cell value must contain the value of the choice, not the label.

Multiple-selection controls require entering the values as a space-separated list of tokens.

#### Exporting from the Form Builder Detail page

With Form Builder, the Excel Export button is available by default. You can control its availability with the following property, by adding the `excel-export` button token. We show here the default value of this property for Orbeon Forms 2023.1:

```xml
<property as="xs:string"  name="oxf.fr.detail.buttons.orbeon.builder">
    home
    summary
    new
    form-definition-xhtml-export|excel-export|xml-export
    test|test-pdf|test-offline|test-formulas
    publish
    save
</property>
```

Note the `|` which denotes combined buttons.

#### Exporting from the Form Runner Summary and Detail pages

With Form Runner, you can enable the export button with the following properties, by including the same `excel-export` button token. Summary page:

```xml
<property as="xs:string"  name="oxf.fr.summary.buttons.*.*">
    home review pdf delete duplicate excel-export new
</property>
```

Detail page:

```xml
<property as="xs:string"  name="oxf.fr.detail.buttons.*.*">
    summary clear pdf excel-export wizard-toc wizard-prev wizard-next save-final review
</property>
```

In addition, you must set the following property to enable export with data on the Summary and Detail pages:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:boolean"
    name="oxf.fr.export.page.enable.*.*"
    value="true"/>
```

The reason for this extra setting is that, even if the user has read access to the form, exporting a form in Excel or XML format can reveal some hidden data.

#### Limitations

As available in Orbeon Forms 2021.1, the new Excel export feature has the following limitations:

- The 24-column mode is not supported.
- Dynamic list of choices (for example dynamic dropdowns) are not supported.
- Nested repeats are not supported.
- Repeated grids or sections are always flattened.
- Section templates are not supported.
- Some form controls are not supported, including:
    - Formatted Text
    - Handwritten Signature
    - Attachments
- No calculations or validations are exported.
