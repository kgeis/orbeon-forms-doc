# Responsive design

## Single column on narrow screens

Orbeon Forms supports [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) for forms you create with Form Builder. The main aspect of this is that when your forms are shown on a narrow screen, for instance on a mobile phone, fields are shown in a single column.

The Form Runner [Landing page](landing-page.md) is also responsive.

## Example

If you have a form with a section containing a grid with two columns, on a desktop or tablet your form might show as:

![Fields as shown on a desktop](../images/responsive-desktop.png)

When the same form is loaded from a mobile phone, fields will automatically be shown in one column to better fit that screen:

<p align="center"><img src="../images/responsive-mobile.png" width="40%" alt="Fields as shown on a mobile phone"></p>

## Limitations

The [Summary page](summary-page.md) and [Published Forms page](published-forms-page.md) are not yet responsive.
