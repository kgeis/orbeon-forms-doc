# Mobile support

Orbeon Forms has a number of features to help with mobile support:

- [Responsive design](responsive-design.md) (see also the [blog post](https://blog.orbeon.com/2015/08/responsive-design.html))
- [Native iPhone/iPad date and time widgets](https://blog.orbeon.com/2011/11/orbeon-forms-now-using-native.html)
- [Better numeric input on mobile](https://blog.orbeon.com/2016/01/better-numeric-input-on-mobile.html)

## Limitations

As of Orbeon Forms 2018.2, mobile support has the following limitations:

- The [Summary page](summary-page.md) and [Published Forms page](published-forms-page.md) pages are not yet responsive.
- There is no mobile application for Orbeon Forms: when using a mobile device, the user must have a connection.
