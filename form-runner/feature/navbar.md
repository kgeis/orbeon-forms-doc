## Configuration

### Logo

See [Default logo](/configuration/properties/form-runner.md#default-logo) for details.

### Language selector

The language selector is enabled by default. You can disable it globally by setting the following property to `false`:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:boolean"
    name="oxf.fr.navbar.language-selector.enable"
    value="false"/>
```

### Login menu

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2018.2]

See [Login & Logout](/form-runner/access-control/login-logout.md) for details.

### Landing page link

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2022.1]

This link points to the Landing page. It is enabled by default, but you can disable it globally by setting the following property to `false`:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:boolean"
    name="oxf.fr.navbar.home-link.enable"
    value="false"/>
```

### Revision History button

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2023.1]

This button opens the Revision History pane. It is disabled by default, but you can enable it or disable it by app/form by setting the following property to `true`:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:boolean"
    name="oxf.fr.navbar.data-history.enable.*.*"
    value="true"/>
```

Form Builder explicitly disables it by default, so if you'd like to enable the Revision History button for Form Builder, you must explicitly enable it:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:boolean"
    name="oxf.fr.navbar.data-history.enable.orbeon.builder"
    value="true"/>
```
