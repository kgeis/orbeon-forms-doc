# Compatibility notes

## Starting with Orbeon Forms 4.2

### Related Orbeon Forms 4.1 and earlier functionality

Up to version 4.1, Orbeon Forms had a few predefined buttons to specify what happens with form data:

- The "Save" button to save data to the database.
- The "Submit" button to save data and show a dialog after saving (with options to clear data, keep data, navigate to another page, or close the window).
- The "Send" (AKA "workflow-send") button to save data and then allow:
    - sending an email
    - sending form data to a service
    - redirecting the user to a success or error page

For more information, see [Configuration Properties - Form Runner](../../../configuration/properties/README.md).

### Deprecated buttons

The following buttons are deprecated:

- `save`: use `save-draft` (up to 2020.1.x), `save-progress` (2021.1 and newer) or `save-final`
- `submit`: use the `send` button with the desired sequence of actions
- `workflow-send`: use the `send` button with the desired sequence of actions
- `workflow-review`: use `review` instead
- `workflow-edit`: use `edit` instead

When the `workflow-send` is used, the behavior matches that of Orbeon Forms 4.1 and earlier. The following properties
are considered to build a process:

- `oxf.fr.detail.send.email`
- `oxf.fr.detail.send.success.uri`
- `oxf.fr.detail.send.error.uri`

### Removed property

The following property is no longer supported:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:boolean"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.send.pdf.*.*"
  value="false"/>
```

Instead, use:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:string"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.send.success.content.*.*"
  value="pdf-url"/>
```

## Starting with Orbeon Forms 4.3

### The validate action no longer supports a property

The `validate` action no longer supports a `property` parameter. In particular, this means that the following property is no longer supported:

```xml
<property
  as="xs:boolean"
  name="oxf.fr.detail.save.validate.*.*"
  value="true"/>
```

This also means that the `maybe-require-valid` process is no longer available.

Instead, use the `save-draft` (up to 2020.1.x) or `save-progress` (2021.1 and newer) process, or customize a process with the `save` action but no `require-valid`.
