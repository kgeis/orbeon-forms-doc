# Scenarios

## 1. Anonymous data capture with administrator

1. Setup at least one user and role for your container.
    - The easiest way to do this with Tomcat, if you don't have already users setup within your system (via a Tomcat realm for example), is to modify Tomcat's `tomcat-users.xml` file, for example as follows:

    ```xml
    <tomcat-users>
      <user
        username="orbeon-admin"
        password="Secret, change me!" 
        roles="orbeon-admin"/>
    </tomcat-users>
    ```

1. Enumerate the role in the following property:

    ```xml
    <property
      as="xs:string"
      name="oxf.fr.authentication.container.roles"
      value="orbeon-admin"/>
    ```
1. Protect Form Builder and, optionally, the Form Runner Home page
    - In web.xml, uncomment the permissions section.
    - Replace:

    ```xml
    <url-pattern>/fr/*</url-pattern>
    ```

    with:

    ```xml
    <url-pattern>/fr/orbeon/builder/*</url-pattern>
    <!-- Optional, to prevent anonymous users from accessing the Form Runner Home Page -->
    <url-pattern>/fr/</url-pattern>
    ```
    and replace the role name:

    ```xml
    <role-name>orbeon-user</role-name>
    ```
1. Set, in `form-builder-permissions.xml`:

    ```xml
    <role name="orbeon-admin" app="*" form="*"/>
    ```
1. Remove demo forms and apps from Orbeon Forms.
  - See [Creating a Production WAR](../../configuration/advanced/production-war.md).
1. Within Form Builder
  - make sure that all your forms have permissions enabled (PE feature only)
  - set the `create` permission for all users
  - set all permissions for the role `orbeon-admin`
  - republish your forms
  - see also [#1860](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1860)
1. Configure forms' buttons
  - You will want only a "Send" or "Submit" button, as a plain "Save" button doesn't make sense in this case.

With this setup:

- Published forms are not protected by the container. They are protected by Form Runner permissions.
- Form Builder is protected by the container so that anonymous users can't create new forms.
- Form Builder also requires `orbeon-admin` at the Orbeon Forms level.
- Any user, logged in or anonymous, can create form data from any published form.
- All other operations (`read`, `update`, `delete`) are not available to anonymous users or logged in users without the `orbeon-admin` role.
Users with the `orbeon-admin` role have
- Users with the `orbeon-admin` role can perform any operations on the form data after they are logged in.

Limitations:

- Anonymous data entry does not support autosave.
- As an administrator, you first have to login, for example by accessing Form Builder, before accessing published forms' Summary page (issue [#1292](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1292)).
