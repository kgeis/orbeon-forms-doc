# Form Definition Format

## Overview

A Form Runner form is an XHTML document with a few twists. It contains:

- XForms markup following certain patterns
- some extension markup for the view

## General rules about modifying the source of a form definition:

It can be tempting to modify the source code of a form definition. But this can be dangerous. The following simple guideline applies:

> Any code which is added to a form definition, and which could not be generated by Form Builder itself, is not guaranteed to be compatible.

The exception is anything that is documented in the Orbeon Forms documentation, for example the [action syntax](/form-builder/actions-syntax.md).

## Form definition

### Head

[IN PROGRESS]

### Body

The standard body of the form looks like this:

```xml
<xhtml:body>
    <fr:view width="..." appearance="...">
        <fr:body>
            <fr:section>
                ...
            </fr:section>
            <fr:section>
                ...
            </fr:section>
        </fr:body>
        <fr:buttons>...</fr:buttons>
    </fr:view>
</xhtml:body>
```

The following attributes and elements are optional:

- the `width` attribute on `<fr:view>`
- the `appearance` attribute on `<fr:view>` (reserved for future use)
- the `<fr:buttons>` element

When the `<fr:buttons>` element is present, Form Runner ignores the buttons configured by default for the detail page, and instead uses the content of the `<fr:buttons>` element.
