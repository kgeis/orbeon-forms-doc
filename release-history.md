# Release History

## Upcoming releases

See the [Orbeon Forms roadmap](roadmap.md).

## About the versioning scheme

Starting with Orbeon Forms 2016.1, Orbeon Forms uses a versioning scheme with the number of the year first followed by the number of the major release during that year.

Since 2013 we have had between two and four major releases a year. As of 2019, we plan to continue having at least two major releases per year. Minor releases, when needed, have an extra digit like 2018.1.1, 2018.1.2, etc. This doesn't change anything to subscriptions or support.
