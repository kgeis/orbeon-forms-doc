# Utility functions



## xxf:is-blank()

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2016.1]

```xpath
xxf:is-blank() as xs:boolean
xxf:is-blank($value as xs:string?) as xs:boolean
```

If no argument is passed, use the context item converted to a string.

If an empty sequence is passed, return `true()`.

Return `true()` if the argument or context item string is a blank string. Otherwise return `false()`.

With one argument, this function returns the same as `not(xxf:non-blank(arg))`.

A string is considered blank if all leading and trailing Unicode whitespace, non-breakable space, zero-width space, and ISO control characters are removed, and the result is the empty string.

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2016.1]

```xpath
xxf:non-blank() as xs:boolean
xxf:non-blank($value as xs:string?) as xs:boolean
```

If no argument is passed, use the context item converted to a string.

If an empty sequence is passed, return `false()`.

Return `true()` if the argument or context item string is not a blank string. Otherwise, return `false()`.

With one argument, this function returns the same as `not(xxf:is-blank(arg))`.

A string is considered blank if all leading and trailing Unicode whitespace, non-breakable space, zero-width space, and ISO control characters are removed, and the result is the empty string.
