## xxf:image-metadata()

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 4.4]

```xpath
xxf:image-metadata($content as xs:anyURI, $name as xs:string) as xs:item?
```

Access basic image metadata.

The function returns the empty sequence if the URL is empty or the metadata requested is not found.

- `$content`: URL pointing to an image
- `$name`: metadata property name
    - `width`: image width in pixels, returns an `xs:integer` if found
    - `height`: image height in pixels, returns an `xs:integer` if found
    - `mediatype`: image mediatype based on the content, returns an `xs:string` of `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif` or `image/bmp` (the formats universally supported by browsers) if found

*NOTE: The function dereferences the content of the URL when called. Accesses to local files are likely to be faster than remote files.*

The following example validates that the image is within 10% of a 1x1 aspect ratio:

```xml
<xf:bind
  ref="uploaded-image"
  constraint="
    abs(
        xs:decimal(xxf:image-metadata(., 'width')) div
        xs:decimal(xxf:image-metadata(., 'height')) - 1.0
    ) le 0.1"/>
```
