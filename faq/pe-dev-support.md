# FAQ - PE and Dev Support

## What is the difference between the Development and Production subscriptions?

See [this page for details](https://www.orbeon.com/pricing).

## Do you provide free or discounted non-profit and/or educational licenses?

In general, we don't, and we couldn't explain why better than [this blog post at 37signals](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2580-why-non-profit-pricing), which we recommend reading.

## Do you have an official list of patches?

We don't have a list of patches you can just download.

However, we do provide custom patches to PE customers on a case by case basis.

* Often such patches are backports of commits publicly available in the public source code repository.
* Sometimes, they are created specifically to address issues you report.

Some patches are also available in the latest stable release of Orbeon Forms PE, which you can find from the [downloads page](https://www.orbeon.com/download).
