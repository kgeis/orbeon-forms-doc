## Introduction

The Formulas console allows you to view formulas errors that occur when testing a form.

Some errors are detected by Orbeon Forms statically, when compiling the form; other errors are detected dynamically, when the form runs and there is user interaction. Both types of errors are shown in the Formulas console.

Each entry shows:

- some context for the error
- the control name, if applicable
- the formula
- the error message
- the count of the number of times the error occurred
