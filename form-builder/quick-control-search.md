# Quick control search

## Availability

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2021.1]

## Rationale

In large forms, it is often difficult to navigate to a specific form control, especially when sections are closed.

The Quick control search provides a quick way to find a control.

## Usage

You use one of the following keyboard shortcuts:

- ⌘J (macOS)
- ⌃J (other operating systems)

The shortcut opens a small dialog. Clicking or pressing the Enter key and then typing a search term allows you to search from the list of available form controls. Upon selection, Form Builder scrolls to the control selected and highlights it.

If the "Open Settings Dialog" option is selected, the "Control Settings" dialog for the control also opens right away.
