## Redirection with the PFC

The following example illustrates how to perform a simple redirection with the PFC. Assume you want some path, `/a`, to be redirect to another path, `/b`. You can do this as follows:

```xml
<page path="/a">
    <action>
        <result page="page-b" instance-passing="redirect"/>
    </action>
</page
```

```xml
<page id="page-b" path="/b">
    ...
</page>
```

Note that you do not have to use `redirect`, but that doing so will cause the user agent to display the path to page `/b` in its URL bar. The `instance-passing` attribute is also unnecessary if `redirect` is already the default instance passing mode.

## Implementing XML services with the PFC

The PFC allows you to very easily receive an XML document submitted, for example with an HTTP `POST`, and to generate an XML response. This can be useful to implement XML services such as XML-RPC, SOAP, or any XML-over-HTTP service. The following PFC configuration defines a simple XML service:

```xml
<page path="/xmlrpc" model="xml-rpc.xpl">  
```

Notice that there is no `view` attribute: all the processing for this page is done in the page model.

The following content for `xml-rpc.xpl` implements an XML service returning as a response the POST-ed XML document:

```xml
<p:config 
  xmlns:p="http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/pipeline"
  xmlns:oxf="http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/processors">

    <!-- The XML submission is available on the "instance" input -->
    <p:param name="instance" type="input" schema-href="request.rng"/>

    <!-- Processing of the XML submission (here we just return the request) -->
    <p:processor name="oxf:identity">
        <p:input name="data" href="#instance"/>
        <p:output name="data" id="response"/>
    </p:processor>

    <!--  TODO: update this, it's obsolete, must use xml-converter -->
    <!-- Generate a response -->
    <p:processor name="oxf:xml-serializer">
        <p:input name="data" href="#response" schema-href="response.rng"/>
        <p:input name="config">
            <config/>
        </p:input>
    </p:processor>
</p:config>
```

Notice the optional `schema-href` attributes which allow validating the request and the response against schemas.
