# Orbeon Forms 2022.1

TODO

## Compatibility notes

### Internet Explorer support

This release no longer supports Internet Explorer. In particular, Internet Explorer 11 is no longer supported.

### Extra elements in initial data POSTed to form

If the data posted contains extra elements, those were ignored prior to Orbeon Forms 2022.1. With Orbeon Forms 2022.1 and newer, they cause an error.

See [Initial data posted to the New Form page](/configuration/properties/form-runner-detail-page.md#initial-data-posted-to-the-new-form-page).
